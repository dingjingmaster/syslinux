There is now a mailing list for SYSLINUX.  See the end of syslinux.doc

**** WARNING: READ THIS IF YOU'RE USING A 2.1.x EXPERIMENTAL KERNEL ****

WARNING: There seems to be a bug in some recent experimental Linux
kernels that causes floppy disk corruption when using the Linux
syslinux installer.  This bug exists in kernels 2.1.79-2.1.86; as far
as I know it was fixed in 2.1.87.
